Subject: Pad size of system memory copy for 1x1 pixmaps
References: bfo#32803 bnc#652523

Temporary description by: Jeff Mahoney <jeffm@suse.com>
 This patch fixes a crash that occured frequently with glibc malloc
 perturbing enabled and was a bit more random otherwise. The issue
 appears to be that the pExaPixmap for 1x1 pixmaps was allocating a single
 byte. The patch uses paddedWidth, which I expect is 4 bytes instead.
